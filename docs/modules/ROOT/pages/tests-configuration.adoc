= Tests Configuration

== `configuration.properties`

The Vividus configuration includes the following parts: profiles, environments and suites.

=== Suites

The property `configuration.suites` defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses:

.configuration.properties
----
configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite
----
The Vividus suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with `*.story` extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel.

The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites.

The following properties are used to configure batches (Vividus doesn't provide any default batch configuration out of the box). `batch-number` is one-based batch index.

NOTE: The properties marked with *bold* are mandatory.

|===

== Known Issues

Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test.

[IMPORTANT]
JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed.

=== Properties

[cols="2,1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Default value
|Description

|`known-issue-provider.fileName`
|`known-issues.json`
|Defines the location of the known issues file

|`known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues`
|`true`
|Defines are potentially known issues detected
|===

=== Known Issues file

The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues.

.known-issues.json
[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
 {
    "VVD-1": { <1>
        "type": "Internal",<2>
        "assertionPattern": "Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\[404\\]" <3>
        "storyPattern": "Validate the Math", <4>
        "scenarioPattern": "Validate equality", <5>
        "stepPattern": "Then `1` is = `2`.+", <6>
        "variablePatterns": { <7>
            "var":  "value-.*"
        },
        "failScenarioFast": true, <8>
        "failStoryFast": true <9>
    }
}
----
<1> [Mandatory] *Identifier* (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system)
<2> [Mandatory] *Issue type.* One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue)
<3> [Mandatory] *Assertion pattern* describes which failed assertions should be considered as known
<4> Story pattern to match failed story name
<5> Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name
<6> Step pattern to match failed step.
<7> Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables.
<8> Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue
<9> Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue

[IMPORTANT]
Use *\\* for escaping of special characters in regular expressions

=== Examples

* To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known *assertionPattern* should match assertion failure, if defined *variablePatterns* should match also.
* If *assertionPattern*/*variablePatterns* matched and you have *story/scenario/step/Pattern* defined, to consider issue known all of them should match.
* If *assertionPattern*/*variablePatterns* matched and you have *story/scenario/step/Pattern* defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known.

== Meta filters

Meta tags functionality can be used to reach several goals:

* Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report.
* Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags.
* Management of capabilities for the particular tests.

=== Levels
Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at Story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at Scenario level, then Scenario level value takes precedence.
----
!-- Story level
Meta:
     @group Login

Scenario: Open Google main page
!-- Scenario level
Meta:
  @severity 1
  @layout desktop
Given I am on the main application page
Then the page title is equal to 'Google'

Scenario: Open Yandex main page
Meta:
  @severity 2
  @layout desktop
Given I am on the main application page
Then the page title is equal to 'Yandex'

Scenario: Open Mail.ru main page
Meta:
  @severity 2
  @layout desktop
  @skip
Given I am on the main application page
Then the page title is equal to 'Mail.ru'
----

=== Properties

Prorerty *bdd.all-meta-filters* is used to set up or override values of default meta tags such as @skip / @layout / @browserWindowSize

Property *bdd.meta-filters* with groovy can be used to select scenarios for execution.
Example:
----
bdd.meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip)
----
In example above it selects all stories/scenarios with tag @group Login and without @skip.

Generic meta tags can be used in test scenarios to markup scenarios appropriately following common rules:



=== 1D tags (@key)
[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Tag
|Description

|`@skip`
|@skip meta tag is used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution
|===


=== 2D tags (@key Â value)
[cols="1,1,3,1", options="header"]
|===
|Tag Key
|Values
|Description
|Example

|@severity
|Numeric values (range 1-5)
|This tag is used to mark importance of the test where, most usually, the smallest number is the most important Test, the highest number is the least important.
|@severity 1 / @severity 2 / ... / @severity 4

|@group
|Any desired value
|Since Vividus version 0.2.3 meta @group is no more mapped to Allure labels since it's not used in the reporting. But it's still can be used by users to mark stories and scenarios for filtering.
|@group Login

|@layout
|There exists following possible values: desktop / phone / phone_portrait / phone_landscape / chrome_phone / chrome_responsive / chrome_tablet / tablet / tablet_landscape / tablet_portrait
|This tag is used to specify layout, using which marked Test or Scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (desktop) value is used.
|

|@browserWindowSize
|Any browser window size in pixels. For ex. 800x600 Note: browser window size should be smaller than screen-resolution.
|This tag is used to specify browser window size. It can be used on both story and scenario levels. In case, if browser size differs between adjacent scenarios, browser window will be simply resized to desired values, browser session will not be restarted. If the tag is not set for story or scenario, the browser window will be maximized to the screen size.
|@browserWindowSize 1024x768
